My warm up routine is something that I have tweaked over many years.
After bouts with finger injuries I decided that I should probably have a solid warm up for the fingers.
I have decided to share my routine here, partly because I want to keep a record of it for myself, and partly because others have expressed an interst in it. 
As an added bonus, I have throw in my current fingerboard routine as well.

## The Grip Types

Before I go through my warm up routine, let's talk about the different grip types I'll be using.

### Half Crimp

This is a grip type where you have all 4 fingers on the hold, generally one finger pad on and fingers at about a 90 degree angle.

### Open Hand (3 Finger Drag)

This is a grip type where you have 3 fingers on the hold, leaving out the pinky, generally with the fingers straight.


## The Warm Up Routine

The routine itself is more or less a copy of the warm up Dave MacLeod's does in [this Youtube video](https://youtu.be/PebF3NyEGPc?feature=shared).
I highly recommend watching the video, as it is a great resource for anyone looking to get into finger boarding.

In order to keep track of time, I use [this app](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=cc.dreamspark.intervaltimer&pcampaignid=web_share) but any interval timer app should do.

I then set the timer up for 10 seconds of work and then 50 seconds of rest with 12 sets in total.
I then follow this structure:
- 3x Hangs from good holds.
- 3x Pull Ups of good holds (I can do about 3 in 10 seconds, with good form).
- 3x Half Crimps
